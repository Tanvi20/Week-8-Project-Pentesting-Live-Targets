# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

I clicked the salesperson info on pages (Red, Green and Blue target) and I see a format "?id=XX" in the url. I manipulated the url by adding a ' to the end of the url. While doing this, I see the red and green page simply redirect and the green page shows a SQL error message saying "Database query failed". 
This output gave away that blue page had SQL Injection vulnerability, as shown in the gif walkthrough which was discovered with a simple sleep command at the public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=?? endpoint. The ?? was replaced with the following SQL syntax: ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' which eventually becomes %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27 when encoded in the url. This extract forced the SQL query to pause for 5 seconds, thus indicating a successful SQL injection.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

For this vulnerability, I used Green Page's Session to Login to the Blue page that had the vulnerability. (Blue and Green pages were used as an example). In the Green Page, I logged in as an admin, and opened the following link that contained the tool to change the PHPSESSIONID- https://35.224.63.197/green/public/hacktools/change_session_id.php
After getting the PHPSESSIONID from the Green Page I copied it and opened the same tool for the Blue Page- https://35.224.63.197/blue/public/hacktools/change_session_id.php. I, then entered the copied PHPSESSIONID of the Green Page to the Set a new PHPSESSIONID field (on blue page) and then clicked the change button.
PS- I was NOT logged in the Blue Website!!!
Now, by going to the following link: https://35.224.63.197/blue/public/index.php, I could see the administrator tools (eg: Users), without ever logging in to the Blue Page.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

<img src="https://github.com/Tanvi20/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/Green_Username%20Enumeration.gif" width="800">

To put this into simple words - The error message I got when a username exists in the database and log in was unsuccessful is BOLDED while it's not when the username does not exist in the databse. Also, using inspect helped. I figured out that the Developer assigned two different classes, "failed" and "failure", to the error message depending on the login attempt. The "failure" class has bold style in css while "failed" class doesn't have the same.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

<img src="https://github.com/Tanvi20/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/Green_Cross%20Site%20Scripting.gif" width="800">

A malicious attacker can inject an XSS in between the <script> tags in their feedback form of the "Contact Us" Page. Except the Green Page, other pages escaped the strings that the users can submit the feedback for.
 
Injected XSS Command:
<script>alert('Tanvi found the XSS, yayyy!');</script>. This XSS command runs once the admin goes to tyhe panel and checks the feedback page. This means, users can submit feedback that when accessed from the admin side, will eventually run code in a script tag!! 


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

<img src="https://github.com/Tanvi20/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/Red_IDOR.gif" width="800">


Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
